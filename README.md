# Competitive Price Intelligence

This repository contains code for a competitive price intelligence system. It includes ML packages for competitor identification and price forecasting, as well as a Flask application for demonstrating the models. The codes here are intended for research and may be helpful for analyzing supermarket prices.

## Overview
This project provides a suite of tools for competitive price intelligence in the retail sector. It is designed to help researchers, policy-makers and businesses understand their competitive landscape, predict price trends, and make data-driven pricing decisions. The repository is organized into three main components: Jupyter notebooks, machine learning packages and a Flask web application.

## Features
- Jupyter notebooks used for research and exploratory data analysis. These notebooks cover various topics, including:
    - Identifying competitors
    - Price imputation and interpolation
    - Price forecasting
    - Multi-class classification of promotion descriptions
    - Estimating the determinants of food prices
    - Assessing promotion impact on competitors
    - Competitor's promotion prediction
- ML packages:
    - Automated competitor identification using dimensionality reduction and clustering.
    - Price imputation for handling missing data in time-series and price forecasting using deep learning models.
- A web interface for interacting with the models.
- Comprehensive API documentation and examples.

## Data Sources
The pricing data used in this repository was collected from supermarkets in Israel and is made publicly available under the 'Price Transparency Law'.

## Additional Notes
- Additional analysis and visualization may be added in the future to further explore the data.
