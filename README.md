# Supermarket price analysis

This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks that analyze prices in supermarkets using various data science techniques. The codes here are intended for research use and may be helpful in identifying competitors, forecasting prices and imputing missing data.

## Contents

- Identifying competitors: This notebook uses dimension reduction techniques together with clustering methods to identify distinct clusters within the data and identify competitors.
- Price forecasting: This notebook explores the use of deep learning methods to forecast prices for a given product.
- Price imputation and interpolation: This notebook uses deep learning methods to impute and interpolate missing prices in the dataset.
- Multi-class classification of promotion description: This notebook uses various machine learning algorithms to classify different types of promotions based on their description.
- Estimating the determinants of food prices: This notebook analyzes the factors impacting food prices using regression analysis.
- Assessing promotion impact on competitors: This notebook evaluates the effect of promotions on competitor price reductions using A/B testing and one-Way ANOVA.
- Competitor's promotion prediction: This notebook uses various ensemble methods to predict promotion strategies of competitors.

### Data Sources

The prices data used in this repository were collected from supermarkets in Israel.

### Additional Notes

- Additional analysis and visualization may be added in the future to further explore the data.
- The code is well-commented and documented, providing explanations and context for each step of the analysis.
